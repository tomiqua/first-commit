<title> Boston Renter's Guide</title>
<body>
    <h1> Boston Renters 
<P> "If you rent—be it an apartment, home, condo, or other unit—you have many rights you may not know 
    about that govern your living space, your use of it, and your landlord's responsibilities. 
    These renters' rights protect you legally and define a good working relationship with your
     landlord. Understanding them and how to enforce them if necessary, can help you be a better 
     tenant, ensure that your living space is in fact liveable, and provide genuine peace of mind.
